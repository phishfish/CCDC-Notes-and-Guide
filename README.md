# CCDC-Notes-and-Guide
CCDC is a competition where you work on a team of 8 to protect a fictional network against a professional Red Team whose goal is to shut down mission critical services (and troll). The competition utilizes many blue team tactics that are usable in real life (and in jobs) such as threat hunting, OS knowledge, incident remediation/response, and communicating on a team.
